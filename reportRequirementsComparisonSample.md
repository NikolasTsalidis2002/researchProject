- **ESRS E1 (Climate):** Strong targets & emissions data, but missing carbon pricing, removals, and quantitative financial risk analysis.  
- **ESRS Social (S1–S4):** Workforce, communities, and consumers well-covered; supply chain disclosures less detailed.  
- **ESRS G1 (Governance):** Strong on ethics, anti-bribery, whistleblowing; partial on lobbying & supplier conduct.  

Novo Nordisk’s 2024 Annual Report demonstrates **substantial progress toward ESRS compliance**, with only a few areas requiring deeper disclosure.
