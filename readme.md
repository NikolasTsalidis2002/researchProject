# Autoformalization of Sustainability Goals and Reasoning in Lean

## üìå Overview
This project aims to **determine whether companies comply with EU sustainability directives** by formalizing sustainability requirements and company disclosures in **Lean**, a proof assistant.  

We build a pipeline that goes from **textual reports and regulations** ‚Üí to **structured facts** ‚Üí to **formal proofs of compliance**.  
The final output is a **compliance argument** that can show:
- ‚úÖ Conclusive compliance  
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Conditional compliance (based on assumptions)  
- ‚ùå Non-compliance or violations

## üéØ Motivation
Current corporate sustainability reporting (e.g. under the EU‚Äôs **CSRD** and **ESRS standards**) is often complex, ambiguous, and hard to verify.  
Our approach makes compliance **transparent, verifiable, and explainable** by:
1. Extracting **facts** from company reports, news, and disclosures.  
2. Matching them to **precise EU sustainability requirements**.  
3. Building **formal Lean proofs** that show whether facts satisfy requirements.  
4. Producing a **structured compliance argument** stakeholders (auditors, regulators) can trust.

## üõ† Project Workflow
1. **Requirement Extraction**  
   - Identify relevant EU sustainability requirements (e.g. ESRS E1 on climate, ESRS S1 on workforce).  
   - Formalize them into precise logical rules.  

2. **Company Statement Extraction**  
   - Extract factual claims from company reports (e.g. Novo Nordisk 2024 Annual Report).  
   - Translate them into predicate logic (e.g. `ReducedEmissions(NovoNordisk, 10%, 2023)`).  

3. **Proof of Correctness**  
   - Build **proof trees** to verify company claims.  
   - Each claim is decomposed step by step until the leaves are **axioms** (universally accepted truths, e.g. ‚Äú1 liter diesel ‚Üí 2.68 kg CO‚ÇÇ‚Äù).  
   - Example:
     ```
     Claim: "Emissions in 2023 = X tons CO‚ÇÇe"
       ‚Ü≥ Derived from: Œ£ (activity data √ó emission factors)
         ‚Ü≥ Activity data: fuel use, electricity, mileage
         ‚Ü≥ Emission factors: diesel = 2.68 kg CO‚ÇÇ/liter, grid = 0.112 kg CO‚ÇÇ/kWh
         ‚Ü≥ Axioms: physical chemistry, government energy stats
     ```

4. **Lean Formalization**  
   - Encode facts and requirements in Lean.  
   - Write proofs that show whether company facts ‚üπ requirements.  
   - Capture **compliance arguments** (conclusive, potential, or violations).  

---

## üìÇ Pilot Tasks
- Pick one industry (pharmaceuticals, starting with Novo Nordisk).  
- Extract 3 facts and match them with ESRS requirements.  
- Formalize facts + requirements in predicate logic.  
- Write manual Lean proofs of compliance.  
- Identify challenges for automation.  

---

## üìà Extensions (Thesis-Level Work)
- Automate fact extraction with LLMs.  
- Expand to other industries (e.g. shipping, energy, governance).  
- Handle **timed requirements** (e.g. ‚Äúby 2030‚Äù, ‚Äúwithin 1 year‚Äù).  
- Integrate argumentation frameworks (e.g. SACM, GSN, LKIF).

## ‚úÖ Expected Outcome
A **proof-of-concept system** where:
- EU sustainability requirements are formalized in Lean.  
- Company disclosures (e.g. Novo Nordisk) are translated into logical facts.  
- Lean proofs determine whether disclosures satisfy EU requirements.  
- Arguments are structured and transparent down to **axioms anyone can verify**.
